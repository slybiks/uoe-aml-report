With more than 456 million active monthly users, Spotify is one of the leading music streaming services \cite{spotify}. By bringing local music to a worldwide audience and utilising machine learning and artificial intelligence to offer its customers a personalised and engaging experience, it has significantly changed the music industry over the past 15 years. Spotify has many songs and artists, and users have a lot of data, essentially converting them into a huge data store on which a lot of research has been done, especially by the Spotify R\&D team \cite{researchpagespotify}. Most of the research going on in Spotify has been related to music recommendation systems and playlists creation, like what Spotify did with Spotify Wrapped \cite{wrappedspotify} and predicting the popularity or the trend of a song \cite{popularity}, for e.g. Grammy awards prediction \cite{grammy}.

Although there are many applications to song clustering, like recommendation algorithms \cite{acmpaper}, our focus is to cluster songs together and then link the artist with similar types of songs. One of the applications this report targets is to help artists collaborate with artists from other regions. For example, if one artist wants to make music for some other region, they can find an artist from the targeted region who works on a similar form of music to get local insights. An example of it would be if a song needs to be translated into a local language, an artist or their team can find a local artist to execute it.
